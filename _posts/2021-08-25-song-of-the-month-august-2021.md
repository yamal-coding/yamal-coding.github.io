In the past month I wrote about the version of an old song that George Harrison performed. This time, I'm talking about a tribute version of a George Harrison's song that some artists performed after he passed away.

The original song is *While my guitar gently weeps*, from the album *The Beatles* released in 1968, but the version chosen for this post is the one performed in *Concert for George*, a live tributte album recorded on the first anniversary of his death at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 29 November 2002. It was performed by numerous artists close to him such as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, his son Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne.

Some other versions of this song are the one by Jeff Healey Band or the one included in the soundtrack of the film *Kubo and the TWo Strings*.
