title:  "My favourite song of the month, September 2022"
---

It's been a while since I made my last appearance in this blog and I think it's time to write my first contribution of 2022, so let's imagine that the time has barely passed...

As I used to do, I'll tell which was my favourite song of this month and then talk a little about some facts related to it. However, at the end of this post I will add a list of my favourite song of every month since my last post.

The other day I was scrolling through my Spotify home page and I saw the tipical "Jump back in" section where they suggest you to listen again to old albums and playlists you used to listen to a lot. There, I saw some compilation album from *Steve Miller Band* called *Greatest Hits 1974-1978* and decided to "jump back" to it again. After burning that compilation three or four times I decided to keep listening to *Steve Miller Band* and ended up checking their *Abracadabra* album from 1982 (the album where my favourite song of this month belongs to).

The song I chose is called *Give It Up*, the second most listened song of that album after *Abracadabra* (based on the stats from Spotify at the time this article is being written). This album is their twelfth studio album and on the contrary of lots of bands, *Steve Miller Band* knew how to adapt to each decade without losing their "touch".

So, let's "jump back in" to the Â¿fun? facts that I usually address in these essays: Did you know that Les Paul, the man who invented one of the most famous guitar models (Gibson Les Paul), was such a close friend to Steve's parents that he even became his godfather? Not only Les Paul were such an influence to him but other great artits from that time such as T-Bone Walker. Steve's father worked as well as a recording engineer, so many artists came to the house were the studio was located.

Given said that, this is already the end of this post, so let's now "jump forward" to the list of my favourite song of each month since September 2021:

- September 2021: *Baby, Please Don't Go - Live* - Muddy Waters, *King Of The Electric Blues*, 1977
- October 2021: *Silly Love Songs* - Wings, *Wings At The Speed Of Sounf*, 1976
- November 2021: *And Your Bird Can Sing* - The Beatles, *Revolver*, 1966
- December 2021: *The End* - The Beatles, *Abbey Road*, 1969
- January 2022: *A Day In The Life*, Grant Green, *Green Is Beautiful*, 1994
- February 2022: *Breeze* - Vicky Sometani, *Breeze*, 2019
- March 2022: *Made Up Mind* - Bonnie Raitt, *Made Up Mind*, 2022

- August 2022: *They Don't Make Them Like You Anymore* - Rory Gallagher, *Tattoo*, 1973

I keep track of every song I like or discover and put them on a new playlist every month. I've been doing this since June 2019, so choosing my last 12 favourite songs has been an easy task.
