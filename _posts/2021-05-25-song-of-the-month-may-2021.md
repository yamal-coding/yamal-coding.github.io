I like to take a deep look at things I like so this month I'm talking again about Neil Young. This time the song is called *Lookin' for a Love* from his album *Zuma* released in 1975 and recorded with Crazy Horse, a band which has accompanied him for many years.

This album brings back the "country" sound of his early works but in this case there are also some "hard rock" songs such as *Drive back*, where we can notice *Old Black*, his 1953 Gibson, a *Goldtop* he exchanged for a *Gretsch* in 1968. He customized it later including and replacing different parts of it.

One more thing I would like to talk about is again the ability of Young to play the guitar (I also mentioneed it in the previous post). However, not everybody thinks the same, there are people who don't like Neil Youngs' style. During a recording session, George Harrison was asked about what he thought about Young's guitar playing style. George said "I hate it, I can't stand it", while he was imitating Young playing.
