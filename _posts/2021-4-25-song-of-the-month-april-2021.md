If you have read the previous posts of this series, you are probably expecting something related to Fletwood Mac. But this time, I'm going to talk about an artist which has nothing to do with them.

*Like a Hurricane* by Neil Young is a song from his eighth studio album *American Stars N' Bars* released in 1977. The full version of the song lasts eight minutes and seventeen seconds but it could perfectly have lasted longer because it gives the sensation of being an endless Neil Young guitar solo that no one wants it to end.

One thing about Neil Young that can go unnoticed is his ability to play the guitar because his solos are subtle and don't seem very powerful at first sight, but actually he is one of the greatest guitar players of all times. *Rolling Stones* magazine placed him in the eighty-third position in its *Top 100 Greatest Guitarrists of All Time* back in 2003. Eight years later he scalated some positions in a reissue of that same ranking where he was moved up to the seventeenth position.
