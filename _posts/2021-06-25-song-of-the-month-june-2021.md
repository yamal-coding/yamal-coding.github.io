It wasn't on purpouse, but in my previous post I mentioned a member of The Beatles. And I'm telling you this because the post of this month is about a Beatles song: *Nowhere Man*, from their 1965 album *Rubber Soul* and written by John Lennon.

It is said that is their very first song that is totally unrelated to love and it also inspired the title of the film from 2009 *Nowhere Boy*, a film about John Lennon's adolescence.

For those who know some basics about music theory, these are the chords used in the song (some chords may vary depending on the different transcriptions of the song): E, A, Am, B, B7, F#m and G#m. And in case you don't know what those letters mean or you were taugh with "Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Si" music nomenclature, then it is as simple as knowing that *A* stands for *La*, *B* for *Si*, and so on until reaching *G* which stands for *Sol*.
