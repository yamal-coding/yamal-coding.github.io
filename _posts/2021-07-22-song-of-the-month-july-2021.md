title:  "My favourite song of the month, June 2021"

In 1959, Chuck Berry released *Roll Over Beethoven*, a song where the author talks directly to Ludwig Van Bethoveen to express his desire for Rock and Roll and Rythm and Blues to replace classical music. According to *Rolling Stone* magize, this is the song number 97 in the ranking of *500 Greatest Songs of All Time*.

However, my favourite song of this month is not Chuck Berry's original version but George Harrison's cover, included in *With the Beatles* album from 1963.

This song has been also interpreted by other musicians and bands through the years, such as Jeff Lynne from Electric Light Orchestra in 1973 (Jeff Lynne would be bandmate of George Harrison some years later in Traveling Wilburys) and *Paul Shaffer and The World's Most Dangerous Band* (whose version was recorded as the main theme for the film *Beethoven*).
